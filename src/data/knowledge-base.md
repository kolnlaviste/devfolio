# Developer Profile: Koln Laviste

## 1. Technical Philosophy & Stack

**Primary Stack:** I am a Full-Stack Developer specializing in the JavaScript ecosystem (Next.js, Express, Node.js) and cross-platform mobile development with Flutter.
**Frontend Approach:** I use React and Next.js to build SEO-optimized, high-performance web applications. I am comfortable with [Tailwind CSS / Styled Components] and state management using [Redux / Zustand / Context API].
**Backend Approach:** For backends, I build robust RESTful APIs using Express.js. I focus on middleware security, JWT authentication, and database integration with [PostgreSQL / MongoDB].
**Mobile Strategy:** I use Flutter to deliver native-performance apps for iOS and Android from a single codebase, specifically focusing on [clean architecture / reactive UI].

## 2. Project Deep Dives

### Project 1: HireLink (Full-Stack Demo)

- **Tech Stack:** React, Express, Node.js, and MongoDB.
- **The Problem:** I noticed that many job boards are cluttered and overwhelming. I wanted to build a streamlined platform where jobseekers could access postings immediately with a focus on speed and clarity.
- **The "Hard Part":** This was my first time bridging a React frontend with a custom Express backend. Managing the data flow and setting up the authentication flow for "sample users" was a significant learning curve. I spent a lot of time debugging CORS issues and ensuring the API endpoints returned the correct JSON structure for the frontend to render.
- **Current State:** The project is currently a functional demo. While I haven't updated the UI in a few months, it serves as a core proof of concept for my ability to handle user authentication and full-stack integration.

### Project 2: TekkioHub

- **The Product:** TekkioHub, a cross-platform solution designed for small businesses to manage multiple branches and surveillance systems without the high cost of enterprise cloud services.
- **The Problem:** Small business owners lacked affordable, integrated tools to monitor their physical locations and manage operations remotely. TekkioHub aimed to fill this gap using Flutter for a unified iOS and Android experience.
- **The "Hard Part":** Transitioning from web development to Flutter was a massive shift in mindset. I had to quickly master Dart and the declarative UI approach of Flutter. As my first professional role in this stack, I had to learn how to contribute to a large-scale codebase while maintaining high standards for performance and code quality.
- **My Contributions:**
  - Developed and optimized reusable UI widgets to maintain design consistency across the app.
  - Spearheaded the implementation of major new features [e.g., real-time alerts or branch switching].
  - Led a design revamp of key screens to improve user flow and modern aesthetics.
- **Key Learnings:** I gained deep experience in state management, responsive mobile layouts, and collaborating with a product team in a professional setting.

## 3. Work & Collaboration

**My Workflow:** I utilize Git for strict version control, following a "Feature Branch" workflow to ensure the `main` branch remains stable and deployable at all times. My process starts with an organized "To-Do" list or Kanban board, where I break down complex features into smaller, manageable sub-tasks. I believe in "Atomic Commits"—frequent, small updates with clear messages—which makes debugging easier and keeps the project history clean.

**Problem Solving & Research:**
When I encounter a technical roadblock, I follow a structured "Documentation-First" approach.

1. **Isolation:** I isolate the bug by creating a minimal reproduction to ensure it's not a side effect of other code.
2. **Research:** I deep-dive into official technical documentation (e.g., Next.js Docs or Flutter API reference) to understand the underlying logic rather than just looking for a quick fix.
3. **Community & Verification:** If the docs don't cover it, I cross-reference GitHub Issues and StackOverflow to see how the community handles similar edge cases.
4. **Implementation:** I implement the fix and then refactor it to ensure it remains modular and doesn't introduce technical debt.

## 4. Passions & Continuous Learning

**Continuous Learning**: I am deeply passionate about the "how" behind the code. I spend a significant amount of my free time studying different programming languages to understand their unique paradigms and how they compare to the stacks I use daily. This curiosity helps me choose the right tool for every project.

**Tech Community & Trends**: I am a frequent explorer of professional networks like LinkedIn to stay on the pulse of the industry. I actively follow updates in the JavaScript and Flutter ecosystems to ensure my development practices are modern, secure, and efficient.

**Balance**: Beyond the screen, I value social connection and team-building. I regularly play games with friends, which serves as a great way to recharge and maintains my ability to collaborate and communicate effectively in high-pressure environments.
